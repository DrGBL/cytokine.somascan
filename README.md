# Cytokine Somascan

This is the code used to fit the generalized additive models from the somascan cytokine project.

`code.R` contains the code, with comments inside. Written with R v4.0.3. Note that the code will do the data cleaning, the model fitting, and the R data object saving in the appropriate folder.

`soma_shuffle.txt` contains shuffled data from 200 made up individuals. This is to help debugging. Provides an example of the format the data should be in for the code to work. No significant association is expected here, since it's all random.
